# Parser Docbook - HTML 

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

## Abstract ðŸ“œ

The Parser Docbook - HTML is a lexical and syntactic analyzer that allows analyzing, validating, and transforming a subset of tags from the DocBook/XML specification for article description.

The program takes an XML file with DocBook content as input and checks whether it adheres to the well-structured standards defined by the specification. In case of any errors or non-compliance, it provides indications about the issues encountered. Additionally, while analyzing the document, it transforms the content into an HTML document, making it easier to display and share the content.
